# routines/golem_crafting.py
#
# Golem Crafting routine: mine sunstone -> chisel it into cores -> carve an empty plinth and
# insert a core + hunter fur to finish a golem (Crafting XP + an uncut gem) -> bank, with an
# automatic fallback to hunting goats at the Goat Pit when the bank has no usable fur left.
#
# Full design and research notes: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-07-golem-crafting-design.md.
# Golem Crafting is a member-only Crafting method on Wyrmscraig, released 2026-07-29 -- 9 days
# before that design doc. The bundled OSRS Wiki mirror (osrs-wiki-data-master/) still tags
# Wyrmscraig.txt and Fallen From Grace.txt {{Future Content}} with no mechanical detail, so
# EVERY object name, menu-option string, and click sequence below comes from a live wiki fetch,
# not the local mirror, and has NOT been cross-checked against the running game the way this
# codebase's other routines verify object/menu names before relying on them. Each such
# assumption below carries its own "ASSUMPTION, NOT YET VERIFIED LIVE" comment, same convention
# as blast_furnace.py's -- correct these during the staged live verification this design's
# Testing section lays out before trusting this routine unattended.
#
# Requirements assumed already met (out of scope for this routine, see the design's Scope):
# Crafting 60, "Fallen From Grace" quest complete, already own a fur pouch (any size).
#
# Deliberately NOT implemented: the XP-drop tick-timing speed-up trick for plinth carving
# (always uses the safe, un-optimized ~15-ticks-per-side cadence); acquiring a fur pouch;
# sourcing fur from anywhere but the bank or the Goat Pit.
#
# Run with:
#     python controller.py routines/golem_crafting.py

# constant, not read from bridge config -- ConfigExporter.exportGolemCrafting deliberately
# doesn't export this list (the player never chooses a fur, same reasoning
# BlastFurnaceBarType's BAR_TYPES table isn't Java-exposed either, see the design's section 3).
# Keeping this a constant that every phase reads directly (rather than config.get("furPriority"))
# means behavior is identical whether get_config() below returns the live bridge config (which
